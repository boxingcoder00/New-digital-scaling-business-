                              SEO is a long-term investment that typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results. However, some improvements like faster loading speeds and better user experience can have immediate positive impacts. The timeline depends on factors like your industry competitiveness, current website state, and the keywords you're targeting.
                                Think of SEO like planting a seedâ€”it requires patience and nurturing before you see growth, but once it takes root, the results compound over time. Unlike paid advertising that stops when you stop paying, a well-optimized website continues generating organic traffic and leads long after your initial investment. When done correctly, SEO often becomes one of the most cost-effective ways to acquire customers, delivering strong ROI as your rankings and authority build momentum.
